  		<h2> Genesis </h2>
  		<p> Cohen left MojoNation in April 2001 to begin work on his new project. He presented his ideas at the first ever CodeCon, an event that he created with his roommate to show off new technology projects after feeling unsatisfied with the state of technology conferences at the time. CodeCon remains popular to this day.</p>
      <br>
      <p> Cohen eventually formed BitTorrent Inc in 2004.
      </p>
  		<h2> What is BitTorrent? </h2>
  		<p> BitTorrent is a protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing. It is now one of the most common protocols for transferring large files, and P2P networks now account for 3.35% of all worldwide bandwidth, which is more than half of the 6% used for file sharing. </p>
      <br>
      <p> In essence, BitTorrent is used to reduce server and network impact of moving large files. Instead of downloading a file from a single source server, users will join a "swarm" of hosts to download and upload from each other at the same time. Each user on the network is a "peer". All clients are capable of preparing, requesting and transmitting any kind of file they want over a network when using the protocol.</p>
      <br>
      <p> To share a file, the peer creates a .torrent file, which contains metadata about the files to be shared and also about the tracker, which is the computer that coordinates file distribution (essentially telling the peer where they can go to download data for the required file). The data is not downloaded sequentially - BitTorrent downloads data in a random or rarest-first manner to ensure all areas of files have good availability to distribute.
  		<h2> Benefits </h2>
  		<p>The difference in distribution method means that BitTorrent is much cheaper to the content provider (as they do not have to invest in large servers with sufficient bandwidth to support classic downloads). There is an immense amount of redundancy in that the file will eventually be located on computers all over the Internet and can be re-acquired from any number of those places.</p>
      <h1> Impact </h1>
      <p> The development of BitTorrent has had an immense impact on the way files are transferred across the Internet. A huge number of organisations are now using the protocol to distribute their material, and independent adopters would simply not be able to distribute files without it, as the dramatically reduced demands on bandwidth are almost a necessity. BitTorrent Inc. has obtained licenses from Hollywood for distributing popular content. A large number of audio companies like music studios and podcasters use the protocol to share their work. Broadcasters like the CBC, NRK and VPRO have begun to use the protocol to share full TV shows. Facebook and Twitter both use the protocol to update servers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>BitTorrent is massively popular among the gaming industry, which is estimated to be worth $100 billion by 2017. Many MMOs and similiar games like World of Warcraft, Eve Online and Diablo III use the protocol in their patching programs.</p>
      <br>
      <p>These are just the tip of the iceberg. As shown by the bandwidth usage above, it's clear that Cohen, with his creation of BitTorrent, has been instrumental in shaping the current state of file sharing across the Internet.</p>
      <h2> Future </h2>
      <p> BitTorrent is still growing. There are constant upgrades and features being added to enhance efficiency among other things. For example, the use of distributed hash tables for some torrents to become "trackerless" and the use of RSS feeds for a content delivery system within BitTorrent.</p>
