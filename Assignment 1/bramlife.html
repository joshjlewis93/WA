  		<p>After dropping out of education, Cohen jumped around several dot-com companies (companies that operate mostly on the Internet) doing various jobs like software engineering. His last project was at MojoNation, a more personal investment for Cohen. At MJN, they allowed people to break up confidential files in to encrypted chunks and distribute those pieces on computers also running the software. If someone wanted a copy of the file, they would need to download it from many computers at once. Cohen realised that this would be a great concept for a file sharing service, since downloads coming from one source were limited to the strength of the connection of the source, usually taking longer than when connected to many sources at once.
